## Self-Label

This code is the official implementation of the ICLR 2020 paper [Self-labelling via simultaneous clustering and representation learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyx-jyBFPr). 

### Abstract
Combining clustering and representation learning is one of the most promising
approaches for unsupervised learning of deep neural networks. However, doing
so naively leads to ill posed learning problems with degenerate solutions. In this
paper, we propose a novel and principled learning formulation that addresses
these issues. The method is obtained by maximizing the information between
labels and input data indices. We show that this criterion extends standard crossentropy minimization to an optimal transport problem, which we solve efficiently
for millions of input images and thousands of labels using a fast variant of the
Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. The resulting method is able to self-label visual data
so as to train highly competitive image representations without manual labels. Our
method achieves state of the art representation learning performance for AlexNet
and ResNet-50 on SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.

## clusters that were discovered by our method

*Random*

The edge-colors encode the true imagenet classes (which are not used for training).

## Requirements
* Python >3.6
* PyTorch > 1.0
* CUDA
* Numpy, SciPy
* (optional:) TensorboardX

## Running our code
Run the self-supervised training of an AlexNet with the command
```
$./scripts/alexnet.sh
```
or train a ResNet-50 with 
```
$./scripts/resnet.sh
```
Note: you need to specify your dataset directory (it expects a format just like ImageNet with "train" and "val" folders). You also need to give the code enough GPUs to allow for storage of activations on the GPU. Otherwise you need to use the CPU variant which is significantly slower.

## Evaluation
### Linear Evaluation
We provide the linear evaluation methods in this repo. 
Simply download the models via `. ./scripts/download_models.sh` and then either run `scripts/eval-alexnet.sh` or `scripts/eval-resnet.sh`.

### Pascal VOC
We follow the standard evaluation protocols for self-supervised visual representation learning.
* for Classification: we follow the PyTorch implementation of [DeepCluster](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deepcluster) with frozen BatchNorm.
* for Segmentation: we follow the implmentation from the [Colorization paper](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization) which uses the [FCN repo](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org). Note: requires the Caffe framework
* for Detection: we follow [Kr√§henb√ºhl et al.'s implementation](https://www.philkr.net/2001/02/01/pub/)
based on the [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn). Note: requires the Caffe framework

## Our extracted pseudolabels
As we show in the paper, the pseudolabels we generate from our training can be used to quickly train a neural network with regular cross-entropy. 
Moreover they seem to correctly group together similar images. Hence we provide the labels for everyone to use.
### AlexNet
You can download the pseudolabels from our best (raw) AlexNet model with 10x3000 clusters [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/self-label/asset/alexnet-labels.csv). 
### ResNet
You can download the pseudolabels from our best ResNet model with 10x3000 clusters [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/self-label/asset/resnet-labels.csv). 

## Trained models
You can also download our trained models by running 
```
$./scripts/download_models.sh
```
Use them like this:
```
import torch
import models
d = torch.load('self-label_models/resnet-10x3k.pth')
m = models.resnet(num_classes = [3000]*10)
m.load_state_dict(d)

d = torch.load('self-label_models/alexnet-10x3k-wRot.pth')
m = models.alexnet(num_classes = [3000]*10)
m.load_state_dict(d)

```
